  # Bug Reports Portfolio

This repository is a collection of professionally structured bug reports created during testing of multiple demo applications. The goal of this project is to showcase real-world defect investigation, clear documentation, and strong QA/SDET thinking.

It is designed to serve as a **public portfolio** that recruiters, hiring managers, and interviewers can review to understand your testing style, depth, attention to detail, and communication quality.
